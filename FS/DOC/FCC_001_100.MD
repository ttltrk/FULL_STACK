### <h2 id='1'>01 - Say Hello to HTML Elements</h2>

Welcome to Free Code Camp's first coding challenge.
You can edit code in your text editor, which we've embedded into this web page.
Do you see the code in your text editor that says ```<h1>Hello</h1>```? That's an HTML element.
Most HTML elements have an opening tag and a closing tag.

Opening tags look like this:

```html
<h1>
```

Closing tags look like this:

```html
</h1>
```

Note that the only difference between opening tags and closing tags is that closing tags have a slash after their opening angle
bracket.

Each challenge has tests that you can run at any time by clicking the "Run tests" button. Once you get all tests passing, 
you can advance to the next challenge.

To pass the test on this challenge, change your ```h1``` element's text to say "Hello World" instead of "Hello". 
Then click the "Run tests" button.

> Your h1 element should have the text "Hello World".

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>ALLDAY</title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

### <h2 id='2'>02 - Headline with the h2 Element</h2>

Over the next few challenges, we'll build an HTML5 app that will look something like this:

The ```h2``` element you enter will create an ```h2``` element on the website.

This element tells the browser about the structure of your website. h1 elements are often used for main headings, 
while ```h2``` elements are generally used for subheadings. There are also ```h3```, ```h4```, ```h5``` and ```h6``` 
elements to indicate different and new
sections.

Add an ```h2``` tag that says "CatPhotoApp" to create a second HTML element below your "Hello World" ```h1``` element.

> * Create an h2 element.
> * Make sure your h2 element has a closing tag.
> * Your h2 element should have the text "CatPhotoApp".
> * Your h1 element should have the text "Hello World".

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>ALLDAY</title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
</body>
</html>
```

[Preview](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ttltrk/WEB/blob/master/FS/APP/02.html)

### <h2 id='3'>03 - Inform with the Paragraph Element</h2>

```p``` elements are the preferred element for normal-sized paragraph text on websites. ```p``` is short for "paragraph".
You can create a ```p``` element like this:

```html
<p>I'm a p tag!</p>
```

Create a ```p``` element below your ```h2``` element, and give it the text "Hello Paragraph".

> * Create a p element.
> * Your p element should have the text "Hello Paragraph".
> * Make sure your p element has a closing tag.

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<p>Hello Paragraph</p>
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>ALLDAY</title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
  <p>Hello Paragraph</p>
</body>
</html>
```

[Preview](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ttltrk/WEB/blob/master/FS/APP/03.html)

### <h2 id='4'>04 - Uncomment HTML</h2>

Commenting is a way that you can leave comments within your code without affecting the code itself.
Commenting is also a convenient way to make code inactive without having to delete it entirely.
You can start a comment with 

```html
<!-- and end a comment with -->
```

Uncomment your ```h1```, ```h2``` and ```p``` elements.

> * Make your h1 element visible on your page by uncommenting it.
> * Make your h2 element visible on your page by uncommenting it.
> * Make your p element visible on your page by uncommenting it.
> * Be sure to delete all trailing comment tags, i.e. -->.

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<p>Hello Paragraph</p>
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>ALLDAY</title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
  <p>Hello Paragraph</p>
</body>
</html>
```

[Preview](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ttltrk/WEB/blob/master/FS/APP/04.html)

### <h2 id='5'>05 - Comment out HTML</h2>

Remember that in order to start a comment, you need to use 

```html
<!-- and to end a comment, you need to use -->
```

Here you'll need to end the comment before your ```h2``` element begins.
Comment out your ```h1``` element and your ```p``` element, but leave your ```h2``` element uncommented.

> * Comment out your h1 element so that it is not visible on your page.
> * Leave your h2 element uncommented so that it is visible on your page.
> * Comment out your p element so that it is not visible on your page.
> * Be sure to close each of your comments with -->.
> * Do not change the order of the h1 h2 or p in the code.

```html
<!--
<h1>Hello World</h1>
-->
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<!--
<p>Hello Paragraph</p>
-->
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>ALLDAY</title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">	
</head>
<body>
<!--
<h1>Hello World</h1>
-->
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<!--
<p>Hello Paragraph</p>
-->
</body>
</html>
```

### <h2 id='6'>06 - Fill in the Blank with Placeholder Text</h2>

Web developers traditionally use lorem ipsum text as placeholder text. 
The ```'lorem ipsum'``` text is randomly scraped from a famous passage by Cicero of Ancient Rome.
Lorem ipsum text has been used as placeholder text by typesetters since the 16th century, 
and this tradition continues on the web.
Well, 5 centuries is long enough. Since we're building a CatPhotoApp, 
let's use something called kitty ipsum text.
Replace the text inside your ```p``` element with the first few words of this kitty ipsum text: 
Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, 
hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.

> * Your p element should contain the first few words of the provided kitty ipsum text.

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<p>Kitty ipsumh</p>
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>ALLDAY</title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">	
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
  <p>Kitty ipsumh</p>
</body>
</html>
```

[Preview](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ttltrk/WEB/blob/master/FS/APP/06.html)

### <h2 id='7'>Delete HTML Elements</h2>

Our phone doesn't have much vertical space.
Let's remove the unnecessary elements so we can start building our CatPhotoApp.
Delete your ```h1``` element so we can simplify our view.

> * Delete your h1 element.
> * Leave your h2 element on the page.
> * Leave your p element on the page.

```html
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles 
chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>ALLDAY</title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">	
</head>
<body>
  <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
  <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles 
  chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

[Preview](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ttltrk/WEB/blob/master/FS/APP/07.html)

### <h2 id='8'>Change the Color of Text</h2>

Now let's change the color of some of our text.
We can do this by changing the style of your ```h2``` element.
The style that is responsible for the color of an element's txt is the "color" style.
Here's how you would set your ```h2``` element's text color to blue:

```html
<h2 style="color: blue">CatPhotoApp</h2>
```

Change your ```h2``` element's style so that its text color is red.

> * Your h2 element should be red.

```html
<h2 style="color: red">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles
chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>ALLDAY</title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>
<body>
  <h2 style="color: red">CatPhotoApp</h2>
  <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles
  chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

[Preview](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ttltrk/WEB/blob/master/FS/APP/08.html)

### <h2 id='9'>Use CSS Selectors to Style Elements

With CSS, there are hundreds of CSS properties that you can use to change the way an element 
looks on your page. When you entered 

```html
<h2 style="color: red">CatPhotoApp</h2>
```

you were giving that individual ```h2``` element an inline style.
That's one way to add style to an element, but a better way is by using CSS, which stands for 
Cascading Style Sheets. At the top of your code, create a style element like this:

```html
<style>
</style>
```

Inside that style element, you can create a CSS selector for all ```h2``` elements. For example, 
if you wanted all ```h2``` elements to be red, your style element would look like this:

```html
<style>
  h2 {color: red;}
</style>
```
Note that it's important to have both opening and closing curly braces ```({ and })``` 
around each element's style. 

You also need to make sure your element's style is between the opening and closing style tags. 
Finally, be sure to add the semicolon to the end of each of your element's styles.

Delete your ```h2``` element's style attribute and instead create a CSS style element. 
Add the necessary CSS to turn all ```h2``` elements blue.

> * Remove the style attribute from your h2 element.
> * Create a style element.
> * Your h2 element should be blue.
> * Ensure that your stylesheet h2 declaration is valid with a semicolon and closing brace.
> * Make sure all your style elements are valid and have a closing tag.

```html
<style>
  h2 {
    color: blue;
  }
</style> 

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles
chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>ALLDAY</title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">	
</head>
<body>
  <style>
    h2 {
      color: blue;
       }
  </style> 
  <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
  <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles
  chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

[Preview](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ttltrk/WEB/blob/master/FS/APP/09.html)

### <h2 id='10'>Use a CSS Class to Style an Element</h2>

Classes are reusable styles that can be added to HTML elements.
Here's an example CSS class declaration:

```html
<style>
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
```

You can see that we've created a CSS class called blue-text within the ```<style>``` tag.
You can apply a class to an HTML element like this:

```html
<h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
```

Note that in your CSS style element, classes should start with a period. In your HTML elements' 
class declarations, classes shouldn't start with a period.

Inside your style element, change the ```h2``` selector to .red-text and update 
the color's value from blue to red.

Give your ```h2``` element the class attribute with a value of ```'red-text'```.

> * Your h2 element should be red.
> * Your h2 element should have the class red-text.
> * Your stylesheet should declare a red-text class and have its color set to red.
> * Do not use inline style declarations like style="color: red" in your h2 element.

```html
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
</style>
<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles
chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>ALLDAY</title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>
<body>
  <style>
    .red-text {
      color: red;
              }
  </style>
  <h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
  <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles
  chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

[Preview](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ttltrk/WEB/blob/master/FS/APP/10.html)

### <h2 id='11'>11 - Style Multiple Elements with a CSS Class</h2>

Remember that you can attach classes to HTML elements by using 

```html
class="your-class-here" within the relevant element's opening tag.
```

Remember that CSS class selectors require a period at the beginning like this:

```html
.blue-text {
  color: blue;
}
```

But also remember that class declarations don't use a period, like this:

```html
<h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
```

Apply the red-text class to your h2 and p elements.

> * Your h2 element should be red.
> * Your h2 element should have the class red-text.
> * Your p element should be red.
> * Your p element should have the class red-text.

```html
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p class="red-text">Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching
attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>ALLDAY</title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>
<body>
  <style>
    .red-text {
      color: red;
    }
  </style>
  <h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
  <p class="red-text">Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching
  attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### <h2 id='12'>12 - Change the Font Size of an Element</h2>

Font size is controlled by the font-size CSS property, like this:

```html
h1 {
  font-size: 30px;
}
```

Create a second ```p``` element after the existing ```p``` element with the following 
kitty ipsum text: 

Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink 
fluffy fur catnip scratched.

Inside the same ```<style>``` tag that contains your red-text class, create an entry for ```p``` 
elements and set the font-size to 16 pixels (16px).

Note

Due to browser implementation differences, you may need to be at 100% zoom to pass the tests on this challenge.
Also, please do not add a class attribute to your new ```p``` element.

> * You need 2 p elements with Kitty Ipsum text.
> * Make sure each of your p elements has a closing tag.
> * Your p element should contain the first few words of the provided additional kitty ipsum text.
> * The first p element should have the class red-text.
> * Do not add a class attribute to the second p element.
> * Between the style tags, give the p elements font-size of 16px. Browser and Text zoom should be at 100%.

```html
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
  p {
    font-size: 16px;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p class="red-text">Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your
ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
<p>Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep 
in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.</p>
```

</html>
```

### <h2 id='13'>13 - Set the Font Family of an Element</h2>

You can set an element's font by using the font-family property.
For example, if you wanted to set your ```h2``` element's font to Sans-serif, 
you would use the following CSS:

```html
h2 {
  font-family: Sans-serif;
}
```

Make all of your p elements use the Monospace font.

> * Your p elements should use the font Monospace.

```html
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
    font-family: Monospace;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: Monospace;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p class="red-text">Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching
attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
<p>Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in
the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.</p>
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>ALLDAY</title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">

    }
    p {
      font-size: 16px;
      font-family: Monospace;
      }
  </style>
  <h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
  <p class="red-text">Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching
  attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
  <p>Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep

</body>
</html>
```

### <h2 id='14'>14 - Import a Google Font</h2>

Now, let's import and apply a Google font (note that if Google is blocked in your country, 
you will need to skip this challenge).
First, you'll need to make a call to Google to grab the Lobster font and load it into your HTML.
Copy the following code snippet and paste it into the top of your code editor:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
```
Now you can set Lobster as a font-family value on your ```h2``` element.
Apply the font-family of Lobster to your ```h2``` element.

> * Import the Lobster font.
> * Your h2 element should use the font Lobster.
> * Your p element should still use the font Monospace.

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">

<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: Monospace;
  }
  h2 {
    font-family: Lobster;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p class="red-text">Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching
attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
<p class="red-text">Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere

### <h2 id='15'>15 - Specify How Fonts Should Degrade</h2>

There are several default fonts that are available in all browsers. These include Monospace, Serif and Sans-Serif
When one font isn't available, you can tell the browser to "degrade" to another font.
For example, if you wanted an element to use the Helvetica font, but also degrade to the Sans-Serif font
when Helvetica wasn't available, you could use this CSS style:

```html
p {
  font-family: Helvetica, Sans-Serif;
}
```

Now comment out your call to Google Fonts, so that the Lobster font isn't available. Notice how it degrades to the Monospace font.

> * Your h2 element should use the font Lobster.
> * Your h2 element should degrade to the font Monospace when Lobster is not available.
> * Comment out your call to Google for the Lobster font by putting <!-- in front of it.
> * Be sure to close your comment by adding -->.

```html
<!--
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
-->
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

### <h2 id='16'>16 - Add Images to your Website</h2>

You can add images to your website by using the img element, and point to a specific image's URL using the src attribute.
An example of this would be:

```html
<img src="https://www.your-image-source.com/your-image.jpg">
```

All img elements must have an alt attribute. The text inside an alt attribute is used for screen readers to improve accessibility 
and is displayed if the image fails to load.
Lets add an alt attribute to our img example above:

```html
<img src="https://www.your-image-source.com/your-image.jpg" alt="Author standing on a beach with two thumbs up. ">
```

Note that in most cases, img elements are self-closing.
Try it with this image:

```html
https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat
```

> * Your page should have an image element.
> * Your image should have a src attribute that points to the kitten image.
> * Your image element must have an alt attribute.

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<style>
  .red-text {

### <h2 id='17'>17 - Size your Images</h2>

CSS has a property called width that controls an element's width. Just like with fonts, we'll use px (pixels) to specify the image's
width.
For example, if we wanted to create a CSS class called larger-image that gave HTML elements a width of 500 pixels, we'd use:

```html
<style>
  .larger-image {
    width: 500px;
  }
</style>
```

Create a class called smaller-image and use it to resize the image so that it's only 100 pixels wide.
Note
Due to browser implementation differences, you may need to be at 100% zoom to pass the tests on this challenge.

> * Your img element should have the class smaller-image.
> * Your image should be 100 pixels wide. Browser zoom should be at 100%.

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  h2 {
    font-family: Lobster, Monospace;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: Monospace;
  }
  .smaller-image {
    width: 100px;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<img class="smaller-image" src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back. ">

### <h2 id='18'>18 - Add Borders Around your Elements</h2>

CSS borders have properties like style, color and width
For example, if we wanted to create a red, 5 pixel border around an HTML element, we could use this class:

```html
<style>
  .thin-red-border {
    border-color: red;
    border-width: 5px;
    border-style: solid;
  }
</style>
```

Create a class called thick-green-border that puts a 10-pixel-wide green border with a style of solid around an HTML element, and 
apply that class to your cat photo.
Remember that you can apply multiple classes to an element by separating each class with a space within its class attribute. For
example:

```html
<img class="class1 class2">
```

> * Your img element should have the class smaller-image.
> * Your img element should have the class thick-green-border.
> * Give your image a border width of 10px.
> * Give your image a border style of solid.
> * The border around your img element should be green.

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<style>
  .thick-green-border {
    border-color: green;
    border-width: 10px;
    border-style: solid;
  }
  
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  h2 {
    font-family: Lobster, Monospace;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: Monospace;
  }

  .smaller-image {
    width: 100px;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

### <h2 id='19'>19 - Add Rounded Corners with a Border Radius</h2>

Your cat photo currently has sharp corners. We can round out those corners with a CSS property called border-radius.
You can specify a border-radius with pixels. Give your cat photo a border-radius of 10px.
Note: this waypoint allows for multiple possible solutions. For example, you may add border-radius to either 
the ```.thick-green-border``` class or ```.smaller-image class```.

> * Your image element should have the class "thick-green-border".
> * Your image should have a border radius of 10px

```html

### <h2 id='20'>20 - Make Circular Images with a Border Radius</h2>

In addition to pixels, you can also specify a border-radius using a percentage.
Give your cat photo a border-radius of 50%.

Your image should have a border radius of 50%, making it perfectly circular.
Be sure to use a percentage instead of a pixel value.

### <h2 id='21'>21 - Link to External Pages with Anchor Elements</h2>

```a``` elements, also known as anchor elements, are used to link to content outside of the current page.
Here's a diagram of an ```a``` element. In this case, the ```a``` element is used in the middle of a paragraph element, 
which means the link will appear in the middle of a sentence.

> * Your a element should have the anchor text of "cat photos".
> * You need an a element that links to http://freecatphotoapp.com
> * Make sure your a element has a closing tag.

### <h2 id='22'>22 - Nest an Anchor Element within a Paragraph</h2>

Again, here's a diagram of an a element for your reference:
Here's an example:

```html
<p>Here's a <a href="https://freecodecamp.com"> link to Free Code Camp</a> for you to follow.</p>
```

Nesting just means putting one element inside of another element.
Now nest your existing ```a``` element within a new ```p``` element (just after the existing ```h2``` element) 
so that the surrounding paragraph says "View more cat photos", but where only "cat photos" is a link, 
and the rest of the text is plain text.

> * You need an a element that links to "http://www.freecatphotoapp.com".
> * Your a element should have the anchor text of "cat photos"
> * Create a new p element around your a element.
> * Your a element should be nested within your new p element.
> * Your p element should have the text "View more " (with a space after it).
> * Your a element should not have the text "View more".
> * Make sure each of your p elements has a closing tag.
> * Make sure each of your a elements has a closing tag.

### <h2 id='23'>23 - Make Dead Links using the Hash Symbol</h2>

Sometimes you want to add a elements to your website before you know where they will link.
This is also handy when you're changing the behavior of a link using jQuery, which we'll learn about later.
Replace the value of your ```a``` element's href attribute with a ```#```, also known as a hash symbol, to turn it into a dead link.

### <h2 id='24'>24 - Turn an Image into a Link</h2>

You can make elements into links by nesting them within an a element.
Nest your image within an a element. Here's an example:

```html
<a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-running-cats" alt="Three kittens running towards the camera. "></a>
```

Remember to use # as your a element's href property in order to turn it into a dead link.
Place the existing image element within an anchor element.
Once you've done this, hover over your image with your cursor. Your cursor's normal pointer should become the link clicking pointer.

The photo is now a link.

> * Nest the existing img element within an a element.
> * Your a element should be a dead link with a href attribute set to #.
> * Make sure each of your a elements has a closing tag.

### <h2 id='25'>25 - Create a Bulleted Unordered List</h2>

HTML has a special element for creating unordered lists, or bullet point-style lists.
Unordered lists start with a ```<ul>``` element. Then they contain some number of ```<li>``` elements.

For example:

```Html
<ul>
  <li>milk</li>
  <li>cheese</li>
</ul>
```

would create a bullet point-style list of "milk" and "cheese".
Remove the last two p elements and create an unordered list of three things that cats love at the bottom of the page.

> * Create a ul element.
> * You should have three li elements within your ul element.
> * Make sure your ul element has a closing tag.
> * Make sure your li elements have closing tags.

### <h2 id='26'>26 - Create an Ordered List</h2>


HTML has a special element for creating ordered lists, or numbered-style lists.
Ordered lists start with a ```<ol>``` element. Then they contain some number of ```<li>``` elements.

For example:

```html
<ol>
  <li>Garfield</li>
  <li>Sylvester</li>
</ol>
```

would create a numbered list of "Garfield" and "Sylvester".
Create an ordered list of the top 3 things cats hate the most.

> * You should have an ordered list for "Top 3 things cats hate:"
> * You should have an unordered list for "Things cats love:"
> * You should have three li elements within your ul element.
> * You should have three li elements within your ol element.
> * Make sure your ul element has a closing tag.
> * Make sure your ol element has a closing tag.
> * Make sure your li element has a closing tag.

### <h2 id='27'>27 - Create a Text Field</h2>

Now let's create a web form.
Text inputs are a convenient way to get input from your user.

You can create one like this:

```html
<input type="text">
```

Note that ```input``` elements are self-closing.
Create an ```input``` element of type ```text``` below your lists.

> * Your app should have an input element of type text.

### <h2 id='28'>28 - Add Placeholder Text to a Text Field</h2> 

Your placeholder text is what appears in your text input before your user has input anything.

You can create placeholder text like so:

```html
<input type="text" placeholder="this is placeholder text">
```

Set the placeholder value of your text input to "cat photo URL".

> * Add a placeholder attribute text input element.
> * Set the value of your placeholder attribute to "cat photo URL".
> * The finished input element should have valid syntax.

### <h2 id='29'>29 - Create a Form Element</h2>

You can build web forms that actually submit data to a server using nothing more than pure HTML. 
You can do this by specifying an action on your form element.

For example:

```html
<form action="/url-where-you-want-to-submit-form-data"></form>
```

Nest your text field in a form element. Add the ```action="/submit-cat-photo"``` attribute to this form element.

> * Nest your text input element within a form element.
> * Make sure your form has an action attribute which is set to /submit-cat-photo
> * Make sure your form element has a closing tag.

### <h2 id='30'>30 - Add a Submit Button to a Form</h2>

Let's add a submit button to your form. Clicking this button will send the data from your form to the URL you specified with your
form's action attribute.

Here's an example submit button:

```html
<button type="submit">this button submits the form</button>
```

Add a submit button to your form element with type submit and ```"Submit"``` as its text.

> * Your form should have a button inside it.
> * Your submit button should have the attribute type set to submit.
> * Your submit button should only have the text "Submit".
> * Make sure your button element has a closing tag.

031 - Use HTML5 to Require a Field

----------------------------------------

You can require specific form fields so that your user will not be able to submit your form until he or she has filled them out.
For example, if you wanted to make a text input field required, you can just add the word required within your input element, you would use: <input type="text" required>
Make your text input a required field, so that your user can't submit the form without completing this field.
Then try to submit the form without inputing any text. See how your HTML5 form notifies you that the field is required?
Note: This field does not work in Safari.

Your text input element should have the required attribute.

035 - Nest Many Elements within a Single Div Element

----------------------------------------

The div element, also known as a division element, is a general purpose container for other elements.
The div element is probably the most commonly used HTML element of all. It's useful for passing the CSS of its own class declarations down to all the elements that it contains.
Just like any other non-self-closing element, you can open a div element with <div> and close it on another line with </div>.
Try putting your opening div tag above your "Things cats love" p element and your closing div tag after your closing ol tag so that both of your lists are within one div.
Nest your "Things cats love" and "Things cats hate" lists all within a single div element.

Nest your p elements inside your div element.
Nest your ul element inside your div element.
Nest your ol element inside your div element.
Make sure your div element has a closing tag.

036 - Give a Background Color to a Div Element

----------------------------------------

You can set an element's background color with the background-color property.
For example, if you wanted an element's background color to be green, you'd put this within your style element:
.green-background {
  background-color: green;
}
Create a class called silver-background with the background-color of silver. Assign this class to your div element.

Give your div element the class silver-background.
Your div element should have a silver background.

037 - Set the ID of an Element

----------------------------------------

In addition to classes, each HTML element can also have an id attribute.
There are several benefits to using id attributes, and you'll learn more about them once you start using jQuery.
id attributes should be unique. Browsers won't enforce this, but it is a widely agreed upon best practice. So please don't give more than one element the same id attribute.
Here's an example of how you give your h2 element the id of cat-photo-app:
<h2 id="cat-photo-app">
Give your form element the id cat-photo-form.

Give your form element the id of cat-photo-form.

038 - Use an ID Attribute to Style an Element

----------------------------------------

One cool thing about id attributes is that, like classes, you can style them using CSS.
Here's an example of how you can take your element with the id attribute of cat-photo-element and give it the background color of green. In your style element:
#cat-photo-element {
  background-color: green;
}
Note that inside your style element, you always reference classes by putting a . in front of their names. You always reference ids by putting a # in front of their names.
Try giving your form, which now has the id attribute of cat-photo-form, a green background.

Give your form element the id of cat-photo-form.
Your form element should have the background-color of green.
Make sure your form element has an id attribute.
Do not give your form any class or style attributes.

039 - Adjusting the Padding of an Element

----------------------------------------

Now let's put our Cat Photo App away for a little while and learn more about styling HTML.
You may have already noticed this, but all HTML elements are essentially little rectangles.
Three important properties control the space that surrounds each HTML element: padding, margin, and border.
An element's padding controls the amount of space between the element and its border.
Here, we can see that the green box and the red box are nested within the yellow box. Note that the red box has more padding than the green box.
When you increase the green box's padding, it will increase the distance between the text padding and the border around it.
Change the padding of your green box to match that of your red box.

Your green-box class should give elements 20px of padding.

----------------------------------------

<style>
  .injected-text {
    margin-bottom: -25px;
    text-align: center;
  }

  .box {
    border-style: solid;
    border-color: black;
    border-width: 5px;
    text-align: center;
  }

  .yellow-box {
    background-color: yellow;
    padding: 10px;
  }
  
  .red-box {
    background-color: red;
    padding: 20px;
  }

  .green-box {
    background-color: green;
    padding: 20px;
  }
</style>
<h5 class="injected-text">margin</h5>

<div class="box yellow-box">

  <h5 class="box green-box">padding</h5>

040 - Adjust the Margin of an Element

----------------------------------------

An element's margin controls the amount of space between an element's border and surrounding elements.
Here, we can see that the green box and the red box are nested within the yellow box. Note that the red box has more margin than the green box, making it appear smaller.
When you increase the green box's margin, it will increase the distance between its border and surrounding elements.
Change the margin of the green box to match that of the red box.

Your green-box class should give elements 20px of margin.

----------------------------------------

<style>
  .injected-text {
    margin-bottom: -25px;
    text-align: center;
  }

  .box {
    border-style: solid;
    border-color: black;
    border-width: 5px;
    text-align: center;
  }

  .yellow-box {
    background-color: yellow;
    padding: 10px;
  }
  
  .red-box {
    background-color: red;
    padding: 20px;
    margin: 20px;
  }

  .green-box {
    background-color: green;
    padding: 20px;
    margin: 20px;
  }

041 - Add a Negative Margin to an Element

----------------------------------------

An element's margin controls the amount of space between an element's border and surrounding elements.
If you set an element's margin to a negative value, the element will grow larger.
Try to set the margin to a negative value like the one for the red box.
Change the margin of the green box to -15px, so it fills the entire horizontal width of the yellow box around it.

Your green-box class should give elements -15px of margin.

----------------------------------------

<style>
  .injected-text {
    margin-bottom: -25px;
    text-align: center;
  }

  .box {
    border-style: solid;
    border-color: black;
    border-width: 5px;
    text-align: center;
  }

  .yellow-box {
    background-color: yellow;
    padding: 10px;
  }
  
  .red-box {
    background-color: red;
    padding: 20px;
    margin: -15px;

  .green-box {
    background-color: green;
    padding: 20px;
    margin: -15px;

042 - Add Different Padding to Each Side of an Element

----------------------------------------

Sometimes you will want to customize an element so that it has different padding on each of its sides.
CSS allows you to control the padding of an element on all four sides with padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left properties.
Give the green box a padding of 40px on its top and left side, but only 20px on its bottom and right side.

Your green-box class should give the top of the elements 40px of padding.
Your green-box class should give the left of the elements 40px of padding.
Your green-box class should give the right of the elements 20px of padding.
Your green-box class should give the bottom of the elements 20px of padding.

  .injected-text {
    margin-bottom: -25px;

044 - Use Clockwise Notation to Specify the Padding of an Element

----------------------------------------

Instead of specifying an element's padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left properties, you can specify them all in one line, like this:
padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;
These four values work like a clock: top, right, bottom, left, and will produce the exact same result as using the side-specific padding instructions.
Use Clockwise Notation to give the ".green-box" class a padding of 40px on its top and left side, but only 20px on its bottom and right side.

Your green-box class should give the top of elements 40px of padding.
Your green-box class should give the right of elements 20px of padding.
Your green-box class should give the bottom of elements 20px of padding.
Your green-box class should give the left of elements 40px of padding.

045 - Use Clockwise Notation to Specify the Margin of an Element

----------------------------------------

Let's try this again, but with margin this time.
Instead of specifying an element's margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left properties, you can specify them all in one line, like this:
margin: 10px 20px 10px 20px;
These four values work like a clock: top, right, bottom, left, and will produce the exact same result as using the side-specific margin instructions.
Use Clockwise Notation to give the element with the green-box class a margin of 40px on its top and left side, but only 20px on its bottom and right side.

Your green-box class should give the top of elements 40px of margin.
Your green-box class should give the right of elements 20px of margin.
Your green-box class should give the bottom of elements 20px of margin.
Your green-box class should give the left of elements 40px of margin.

046 - Style the HTML Body Element

----------------------------------------

Now let's start fresh and talk about CSS inheritance.
Every HTML page has a body element.
We can prove that the body element exists here by giving it a background-color of black.
We can do this by adding the following to our style element:
body {
  background-color: black;
}

Give your body element the background-color of black.
Make sure your CSS rule is properly formatted with both opening and closing curly brackets.
Make sure your CSS rule ends with a semi-colon.

----------------------------------------

<style>
body {
  background-color: black;
}
</style>

047 - Inherit Styles from the Body Element

----------------------------------------

Now we've proven that every HTML page has a body element, and that its body element can also be styled with CSS.
Remember, you can style your body element just like any other HTML element, and all your other elements will inherit your body element's styles.
First, create a h1 element with the text Hello World
Then, let's give all elements on your page the color of green by adding color: green; to your body element's style declaration.
Finally, give your body element the font-family of Monospace by adding font-family: Monospace; to your body element's style declaration.

Create an h1 element.
Your h1 element should have the text Hello World.
Make sure your h1 element has a closing tag.
Give your body element the color property of green.
Give your body element the font-family property of Monospace.
Your h1 element should inherit the font Monospace from your body element.
Your h1 element should inherit the color green from your body element.

----------------------------------------

<style>
  body {
    color: green;
    font-family: Monospace;
  }

</style>
<h1>Hello world</h1>

----------------------------------------

<!DOCTYPE html>

048 - Prioritize One Style Over Another 

----------------------------------------

Sometimes your HTML elements will receive multiple styles that conflict with one another.
For example, your h1 element can't be both green and pink at the same time.
Let's see what happens when we create a class that makes text pink, then apply it to an element. Will our class override the body element's color: green; CSS property?
Create a CSS class called pink-text that gives an element the color pink.
Give your h1 element the class of pink-text.

Your h1 element should have the class pink-text.
Your <style> should have a pink-text CSS class with its color set to pink.
Your h1 element should be pink.

----------------------------------------

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: Monospace;
    color: green;
  }
  .pink-text {
    color: pink;
  }
</style>
<h1 class="pink-text">Hello World!</h1>

----------------------------------------

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>

<title>ALLDAY</title>

<style>
  body {

  }
  .pink-text {
    color: pink;
  }
</style>
<h1 class="pink-text">Hello World!</h1>

</body>
</html>

----------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------

049 - Override Styles in Subsequent CSS

----------------------------------------

Our "pink-text" class overrode our body element's CSS declaration!
We just proved that our classes will override the body element's CSS. So the next logical question is, what can we do to override our pink-text class?
Create an additional CSS class called blue-text that gives an element the color blue. Make sure it's below your pink-text class declaration.
Apply the blue-text class to your h1 element in addition to your pink-text class, and let's see which one wins.
Applying multiple class attributes to a HTML element is done with a space between them like this:
class="class1 class2"
Note: It doesn't matter which order the classes are listed in the HTML element.
However, the order of the class declarations in the <style> section are what is important. The second declaration will always take precedence over the first. Because .blue-text is declared second, it overrides the attributes of .pink-text

Your h1 element should have the class pink-text.
Your h1 element should have the class blue-text.
Both blue-text and pink-text should belong to the same h1 element.
Your h1 element should be blue.

----------------------------------------

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: Monospace;
    color: green;
  }
  .pink-text {
    color: pink;
  }
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
<h1 class="pink-text blue-text">Hello World!</h1>

  }
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;

050 - Override Class Declarations by Styling ID Attributes

----------------------------------------

We just proved that browsers read CSS from top to bottom. That means that, in the event of a conflict, the browser will use whichever CSS declaration came last.
But we're not done yet. There are other ways that you can override CSS. Do you remember id attributes?
Let's override your pink-text and blue-text classes, and make your h1 element orange, by giving the h1 element an id and then styling that id.
Give your h1 element the id attribute of orange-text. Remember, id styles look like this:
<h1 id="orange-text">
Leave the blue-text and pink-text classes on your h1 element.
Create a CSS declaration for your orange-text id in your style element. Here's an example of what this looks like:
#brown-text {
  color: brown;
}
Note: It doesn't matter whether you declare this css above or below pink-text class, since id attribute will always take precedence.

Your h1 element should have the class pink-text.
Your h1 element should have the class blue-text.
Give your h1 element the id of orange-text.
Create a CSS declaration for your orange-text id
Do not give your h1 any style attributes.
Your h1 element should be orange.

----------------------------------------

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: Monospace;
    color: green;
  }
  .pink-text {
    color: pink;
  }
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
  #orange-text {
    color: orange;
  }

051 - Override Class Declarations with Inline Styles

----------------------------------------

So we've proven that id declarations override class declarations, regardless of where they are declared in your style element CSS.
There are other ways that you can override CSS. Do you remember inline styles?
Use an in-line style to try to make our h1 element white. Remember, in line styles look like this:
<h1 style="color: green">
Leave the blue-text and pink-text classes on your h1 element.

Your h1 element should have the class pink-text.
Your h1 element should have the class blue-text.
Your h1 element should have the id of orange-text.
Give your h1 element the inline style of color: white.
Your h1 element should be white.

----------------------------------------

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: Monospace;
    color: green;
  }
  #orange-text {

  .pink-text {
    color: pink;

052 - Override All Other Styles by using Important

----------------------------------------

Yay! We just proved that in-line styles will override all the CSS declarations in your style element.
But wait. There's one last way to override CSS. This is the most powerful method of all. But before we do it, let's talk about why you would ever want to override CSS.
In many situations, you will use CSS libraries. These may accidentally override your own CSS. So when you absolutely need to be sure that an element has specific CSS, you can use !important
Let's go all the way back to our pink-text class declaration. Remember that our pink-text class was overridden by subsequent class declarations, id declarations, and in-line styles.
Let's add the keyword !important to your pink-text element's color declaration to make 100% sure that your h1 element will be pink.
An example of how to do this is:
color: red !important;

Your h1 element should have the class pink-text.
Your h1 element should have the class blue-text.
Your h1 element should have the id of orange-text.
Your h1 element should have the inline style of color: white.
Your pink-text class declaration should have the !important keyword to override all other declarations.
Your h1 element should be pink.

----------------------------------------

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: Monospace;
    color: green;
  }
  #orange-text {
    color: orange;
  }
  .pink-text {
    color: pink !important;

053 - Use Hex Code for Specific Colors

----------------------------------------

Did you know there are other ways to represent colors in CSS? One of these ways is called hexadecimal code, or hex code for short.
We usually use decimals, or base 10 numbers, which use the symbols 0 to 9 for each digit. Hexadecimals (or hex) are base 16 numbers. This means it uses sixteen distinct symbols. Like decimals, the symbols 0-9 represents values zero to nine. Then A,B,C,D,E,F represent values ten to fifteen. Altogether, 0 to F can represent a digit in hexadecimal, giving us 16 total possible values. You can find more information about hexadecimal numbers here.
In CSS, we can use 6 hexadecimal digits to represent colors, two each for the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) components. For example, #000000 is black and is also the lowest possible value. You can find more information about the RGB color system here.
Replace the word black in our body element's background-color with its hex code representation, #000000.

Give your body element the background-color of black.
Use the hex code for the color black instead of the word black. For example body { color: #000000; }

----------------------------------------

<style>
  body {
    background-color: #000000;
  }
</style>

054 - Use Hex Code to Mix Colors

----------------------------------------

To review, hex codes use 6 hexadecimal digits to represent colors, two each for red (R), green (G), and blue (B) components.
From these three pure colors (red, green, and blue), we can vary the amounts of each to create over 16 million other colors!
For example, orange is pure red, mixed with some green, and no blue. In hex code, this translates to being #FFA500.
The digit 0 is the lowest number in hex code, and represents a complete absence of color.
The digit F is the highest number in hex code, and represents the maximum possible brightness.
Replace the color words in our style element with their correct hex codes.

Give your h1 element with the text I am red! the color red.
Use the hex code for the color red instead of the word red.
Give your h1 element with the text I am green! the color green.
Use the hex code for the color green instead of the word green.
Give your h1 element with the text I am dodger blue! the color dodger blue.
Use the hex code for the color dodger blue instead of the word dodgerblue.
Give your h1 element with the text I am orange! the color orange.
Use the hex code for the color orange instead of the word orange.

----------------------------------------

<style>
  .red-text {
    color: #FF0000;
  }
  .green-text {
    color: #00FF00;

  .dodger-blue-text {
    color: #2998E4;

  .orange-text {
    color: 	#FFA500;

<h1 class="red-text">I am red!</h1>

055 - Use Abbreviated Hex Code

----------------------------------------

Many people feel overwhelmed by the possibilities of more than 16 million colors. And it's difficult to remember hex code. Fortunately, you can shorten it.
For example, red's hex code #FF0000 can be shortened to #F00. This shortened form gives one digit for red, one digit for green, and one digit for blue.
This reduces the total number of possible colors to around 4,000. But browsers will interpret #FF0000 and #F00 as exactly the same color.
Go ahead, try using the abbreviated hex codes to color the correct elements.

Give your h1 element with the text I am red! the color red.
Use the abbreviate hex code for the color red instead of the hex code #FF0000.
Give your h1 element with the text I am green! the color green.
Use the abbreviated hex code for the color green instead of the hex code #00FF00.
Give your h1 element with the text I am cyan! the color cyan.
Use the abbreviated hex code for the color cyan instead of the hex code #00FFFF.
Give your h1 element with the text I am fuchsia! the color fuchsia.
Use the abbreviated hex code for the color fuchsia instead of the hex code #FF00FF.

----------------------------------------

<style>
  .red-text {
    color: #F00;
  }
  .fuchsia-text {
    color: #F0F;
  }
  .cyan-text {
    color: #0FF;
  }
  .green-text {
    color: #0F0;
  }
</style>

<h1 class="red-text">I am red!</h1>

<h1 class="fuchsia-text">I am fuchsia!</h1>

056 - Use RGB values to Color Elements

----------------------------------------

Another way you can represent colors in CSS is by using RGB values.
The RGB value for black looks like this:
rgb(0, 0, 0)
The RGB value for white looks like this:
rgb(255, 255, 255)
Instead of using six hexadecimal digits like you do with hex code, with RGB you specify the brightness of each color with a number between 0 and 255.
If you do the math, the two digits for one color equal 16 times 16, which gives us 256 total values. So RGB, which starts counting from zero, has the exact same number of possible values as hex code.
Let's replace the hex code in our body element's background color with the RGB value for black: rgb(0, 0, 0)

Your body element should have a black background.
Use rgb to give your body element a color of black. For example body { background-color: rgb(255, 165, 0); }

----------------------------------------

<style>
  body {
    background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);
  }
</style>

057 - Use RGB to Mix Colors

----------------------------------------

Just like with hex code, you can mix colors in RGB by using combinations of different values.
Replace the color words in our style element with their correct RGB values.

Give your h1 element with the text I am red! the color red.
Use rgb for the color red.
Give your h1 element with the text I am orchid! the color orchid.
Use rgb for the color orchid.
Give your h1 element with the text I am blue! the color blue.
Use rgb for the color blue.
Give your h1 element with the text I am sienna! the color sienna.
Use rgb for the color sienna.

----------------------------------------

<style>
  .red-text {
    color: rgb(255, 0, 0);
  }
  .orchid-text {
    color: rgb(218, 112, 214);
  }
  .sienna-text {

058 - Use Responsive Design with Bootstrap Fluid Containers

----------------------------------------

In the HTML5 and CSS section of FreeCodeCamp we built a Cat Photo App. Now let's go back to it. This time, we'll style it using the popular Bootstrap responsive CSS framework.
Bootstrap will figure out how wide your screen is and respond by resizing your HTML elements - hence the name Responsive Design.
With responsive design, there is no need to design a mobile version of your website. It will look good on devices with screens of any width.
You can add Bootstrap to any app by adding the following code to the top of your HTML:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"/>
In this case, we've already added it for you to this page behind the scenes.
To get started, we should nest all of our HTML in a div element with the class container-fluid.

Your div element should have the class container-fluid.
Make sure your div element has a closing tag.
Make sure you have nested all HTML elements in .container-fluid.

059 - Make Images Mobile Responsive 

----------------------------------------

First, add a new image below the existing one. Set its src attribute to https://bit.ly/fcc-running-cats.
It would be great if this image could be exactly the width of our phone's screen.
Fortunately, with Bootstrap, all we need to do is add the img-responsive class to your image. Do this, and the image should perfectly fit the width of your page.

You should have a total of two images.
Your new image should be below your old one and have the class img-responsive.
Your new image should not have the class smaller-image.
Your new image should have a src of https://bit.ly/fcc-running-cats.
Make sure your new img element has a closing angle bracket.

060 - Center Text with Bootstrap

----------------------------------------

Now that we're using Bootstrap, we can center our heading element to make it look better. All we need to do is add the class text-center to our h2 element.
Remember that you can add several classes to the same element by separating each of them with a space, like this:
<h2 class="red-text text-center">your text</h2>

Your h2 element should be centered by applying the class text-center
Your h2 element should still have the class red-text

061 - Create a Bootstrap Button

----------------------------------------

Bootstrap has its own styles for button elements, which look much better than the plain HTML ones.
Create a new button element below your large kitten photo. Give it the class btn and the text of "Like".

Create a new button element with the text "Like".
Your new button should have the class btn.
Make sure all your button elements have a closing tag.

062 - Create a Block Element Bootstrap Button

----------------------------------------

Normally, your button elements with a class of btn are only as wide as the text that they contain. For example:
<button class="btn">Submit</button>
This button would only be as wide as the word "Submit".
Submit
By making them block elements with the additional class of btn-block, your button will stretch to fill your page's entire horizontal space and any elements following it will flow onto a "new line" below the block.
<button class="btn btn-block">Submit</button>
This button would take up 100% of the available width.
Submit
Note that these buttons still need the btn class.
Add Bootstrap's btn-block class to your Bootstrap button.

Your button should still have the class btn.
Your button should have the class btn-block.
Make sure all your button elements have a closing tag.

The btn-primary class is the main color you'll use in your app. It is useful for highlighting actions you want your user to take.
Add Bootstrap's btn-primary class to your button.
Note that this button will still need the btn and btn-block classes.

Your button should have the class btn-primary.
Your button should still have the btn and btn-block classes.
Make sure all your button elements have a closing tag.

064 - Call out Optional Actions with Button Info

----------------------------------------

Bootstrap comes with several pre-defined colors for buttons. The btn-info class is used to call attention to optional actions that the user can take.
Create a new block-level Bootstrap button below your "Like" button with the text "Info", and add Bootstrap's btn-info and btn-block classes to it.
Note that these buttons still need the btn and btn-block classes.

Create a new button element with the text "Info".
Both of your Bootstrap buttons should have the btn and btn-block classes.
Your new button should have the class btn-info.
Make sure all your button elements have a closing tag.

065 - Warn your Users of a Dangerous Action

----------------------------------------

Bootstrap comes with several pre-defined colors for buttons. The btn-danger class is the button color you'll use to notify users that the button performs a destructive action, such as deleting a cat photo.
Create a button with the text "Delete" and give it the class btn-danger.
Note that these buttons still need the btn and btn-block classes.

Create a new button element with the text "Delete".
All of your Bootstrap buttons should have the btn and btn-block classes.
Your new button should have the class btn-danger.
Make sure all your button elements have a closing tag.

066 - Use the Bootstrap Grid to Put Elements Side By Side

----------------------------------------

Bootstrap uses a responsive grid system, which makes it easy to put elements into rows and specify each element's relative width. Most of Bootstrap's classes can be applied to a div element.
Here's a diagram of how Bootstrap's 12-column grid layout works:
an image illustrating Bootstrap's grid system
Note that in this illustration, the col-md-* class is being used. Here, md means medium, and * is a number specifying how many columns wide the element should be. In this case, the column width of an element on a medium-sized screen, such as a laptop, is being specified.
In the Cat Photo App that we're building, we'll use col-xs-*, where xs means extra small (like an extra-small mobile phone screen), and * is the number of columns specifying how many columns wide the element should be.
Put the Like, Info and Delete buttons side-by-side by nesting all three of them within one <div class="row"> element, then each of them within a <div class="col-xs-4"> element.
The row class is applied to a div, and the buttons themselves can be nested within it.

Your buttons should all be nested within the same div element with the class row.
Each of your Bootstrap buttons should be nested within its own div element with the class col-xs-4.
Make sure each of your button elements has a closing tag.
Make sure each of your div elements has a closing tag.

067 - Ditch Custom CSS for Bootstrap

----------------------------------------

We can clean up our code and make our Cat Photo App look more conventional by using Bootstrap's built-in styles instead of the custom styles we created earlier.
Don't worry - there will be plenty of time to customize our CSS later.
Delete the .red-text, p, and .smaller-image CSS declarations from your style element so that the only declarations left in your style element are h2 and thick-green-border.
Then delete the p element that contains a dead link. Then remove the red-text class from your h2 element and replace it with the text-primary Bootstrap class.
Finally, remove the "smaller-image" class from your first img element and replace it with the img-responsive class.

Your h2 element should no longer have the class red-text.
Your h2 element should now have the class text-primary.
Your paragraph elements should no longer use the font Monospace.
Remove the smaller-image class from your top image.
Add the img-responsive class to your top image.

068 - Use Spans for Inline Elements

----------------------------------------

You can use spans to create inline elements. Remember when we used the btn-block class to make the button fill the entire row?
This image illustrates the difference between inline elements and block-level elements:
An 
By using the span element, you can put several elements together, and even style different parts of the same element differently.
Nest the word "love" in your "Things cats love" element below within a span element. Then give that span the class text-danger to make the text red.
Here's how you would do this with the "Top 3 things cats hate" element:
<p>Top 3 things cats <span class = "text-danger">hate:</span></p>

Your span element should be inside your p element.
Your span element should have the text love.
Your span element should have class text-danger.
Make sure your span element has a closing tag.

069 - Create a Custom Heading

----------------------------------------

We will make a simple heading for our Cat Photo App by putting the title and relaxing cat image in the same row.
Remember, Bootstrap uses a responsive grid system, which makes it easy to put elements into rows and specify each element's relative width. Most of Bootstrap's classes can be applied to a div element.
Here's a diagram of how Bootstrap's 12-column grid layout works:
an image illustrating Bootstrap's grid system
Note that in this illustration, the col-md-* class is being used. Here, md means medium, and * is a number specifying how many columns wide the element should be. In this case, the column width of an element on a medium-sized screen, such as a laptop, is being specified.
In the Cat Photo App that we're building, we'll use col-xs-*, where xs means extra small (like an extra-small mobile phone screen), and * is the number of columns specifying how many columns wide the element should be.
Nest your first image and your h2 element within a single <div class="row"> element. Nest your h2 element within a <div class="col-xs-8"> and your image in a <div class="col-xs-4"> so that they are on the same line.
Notice how the image is now just the right size to fit along the text?

Your h2 element and topmost img element should both be nested together within a div element with the class row.
Nest your topmost img element within a div with the class col-xs-4.
Nest your h2 element within a div with the class col-xs-8.
Make sure each of your div elements has a closing tag.

070 - Add Font Awesome Icons to our Buttons

----------------------------------------

Font Awesome is a convenient library of icons. These icons are vector graphics, stored in the .svg file format. These icons are treated just like fonts. You can specify their size using pixels, and they will assume the font size of their parent HTML elements.
You can add Font Awesome to any app just by including it by adding the following code to the top of your HTML:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.5.0/css/font-awesome.min.css"/>
In this case, we've already added it for you to this page behind the scenes.
The i element was originally used to make other elements italic, but is now commonly used for icons. You add the Font Awesome classes to the i element to turn it into an icon, for example:
<i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>
Use Font Awesome to add a thumbs-up icon to your like button by giving it an i element with the classes fa and fa-thumbs-up.

Add an i element with the classes fa and fa-thumbs-up.
Your fa-thumbs-up icon should be located within the Like button.
Nest your i element within your button element.
Make sure your i element has a closing tag.

Font Awesome is a convenient library of icons. These icons are vector graphics, stored in the .svg file format. These icons are treated just like fonts. You can specify their size using pixels, and they will assume the font size of their parent HTML elements.

Use Font Awesome to add an info-circle icon to your info button and a trash icon to your delete button.

You should add a <i class="fa fa-trash"></i> within your delete button element.
You should add a <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> within your info button element.
Make sure each of your i elements has a closing tag and <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></i> is in your like button element.

072 - Responsively Style Radio Buttons

----------------------------------------

You can use Bootstrap's col-xs-* classes on form elements, too! This way, our radio buttons will be evenly spread out across the page, regardless of how wide the screen resolution is.

Nest all of your radio buttons within a <div class="row"> element. Then nest each of them within a <div class="col-xs-6"> element.

Nest all of your radio buttons inside one div with the class row.
Nest each of your radio buttons inside its own div with the class col-xs-6.
Make sure each of your div elements has a closing tag.

075 - Line up Form Elements Responsively with Bootstrap

----------------------------------------

Now let's get your form input and your submission button on the same line. We'll do this the same way we have previously: by using a div element with the class row, and other div elements within it using the col-xs-* class.

Nest both your form's text input and submit button within a div with the class row. Nest your form's text input within a div with the class of col-xs-7. Nest your form's submit button in a div with the class col-xs-5.

This is the last challenge we'll do for our Cat Photo App for now. We hope you've enjoyed learning Font Awesome, Bootstrap, and responsive design!

Nest your form submission button and text input in a div with class row.
Nest your form text input in a div with the class col-xs-7.
Nest your form submission button in a div with the class col-xs-5.
Make sure each of your div elements has a closing tag.

076 - Create a Bootstrap Headline

----------------------------------------

Now let's build something from scratch to practice our HTML, CSS and Bootstrap skills.

We'll build a jQuery playground, which we'll soon put to use in our jQuery challenges.

To start with, create an h3 element, with the text jQuery Playground.

Color your h3 element with the text-primary Bootstrap class, and center it with the text-center Bootstrap class.

Add a h3 element to your page.
Make sure your h3 element has a closing tag.
Your h3 element should be colored by applying the class text-primary
Your h3 element should be centered by applying the class text-center
Your h3 element should have the text jQuery Playground.

084 - Add ID Attributes to Bootstrap Elements

----------------------------------------

Recall that in addition to class attributes, you can give each of your elements an id attribute.

Each id must be unique to a specific element and used only once per page.

Let's give a unique id to each of our div elements of class well.

Remember that you can give an element an id like this:

<div class="well" id="center-well">

Give the well on the left the id of left-well. Give the well on the right the id of right-well.

Give your left well the id of left-well.
Give your right well the id of right-well.

085 - Label Bootstrap Wells

----------------------------------------

For the sake of clarity, let's label both of our wells with their ids.

Above your left-well, inside its col-xs-6 div element, add a h4 element with the text #left-well.

Above your right-well, inside its col-xs-6 div element, add a h4 element with the text #right-well.

Add an h4 element to each of your <div class="col-xs-6"> elements.
One h4 element should have the text #left-well.
One h4 element should have the text #right-well.
Make sure all your h4 elements have closing tags.

Give each of your buttons a unique id, starting with target1 and ending with target6.

Make sure that target1 to target3 are in #left-well, and target4 to target6 are in #right-well.

One button element should have the id target1.
One button element should have the id target2.
One button element should have the id target3.
One button element should have the id target4.
One button element should have the id target5.
One button element should have the id target6.

When we start using jQuery, we will modify HTML elements without needing to actually change them in HTML.

Let's make sure that everyone knows they shouldn't actually modify any of th
is code directly.

Remember that you can start a comment with <!-- and end a comment with -->

Add a comment at the top of your HTML that says Only change code above this line.

Start a comment with <!-- at the top of your HTML.
Your comment should have the text Only change code above this line.
Be sure to close your comment with -->.
You should have the same number of comment openers and closers.

<!-- Only change code above this line. -->

089 - Learn how Script Tags and Document Ready Work

----------------------------------------

Now we're ready to learn jQuery, the most popular JavaScript tool of all time. Don't worry about JavaScript itself - we will cover it soon.

Before we can start using jQuery, we need to add some things to our HTML.

First, add a script element at the top of your page. Be sure to close it on the following line.

Your browser will run any JavaScript inside a script element, including jQuery.

Inside your script element, add this code: $(document).ready(function() { to your script. Then close it on the following line (still inside your script element) with: });

We'll learn more about functions later. The important thing to know is that code you put inside this function will run as soon as your browser has loaded your page.

This is important because without your document ready function, your code may run before your HTML is rendered, which would cause bugs.

Create a script element making sure it is valid and has a closing tag.
You should add $(document).ready(function() { to the beginning of your script element.
Close your $(document).ready(function() { function with });

----------------------------------------

<script>
$(document).ready(function() {
  });
</script>

090 - Target HTML Elements with Selectors Using jQuery

----------------------------------------

Now we have a document ready function.

Now let's write our first jQuery statement. All jQuery functions start with a $, usually referred to as a dollar sign operator, or as bling.

jQuery often selects an HTML element with a selector, then does something to that element.

For example, let's make all of your button elements bounce. Just add this code inside your document ready function:

$("button").addClass("animated bounce");

Note that we've already included both the jQuery library and the Animate.css library in the background so that you can use them in the editor. So you are using jQuery to apply the Animate.css bounce class to your button elements.

Additionally make sure to use $("button").addClass("animated bounce"); instead of $('button').addClass("animated bounce"); since single-quote selectors will not pass our tests.

Use the jQuery addClass() function to give the classes animated and bounce to your button elements.
Only use jQuery to add these classes to the element.

----------------------------------------

<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $("button").addClass("animated bounce");

  });
</script>

091 - Target Elements by Class Using jQuery

----------------------------------------

You see how we made all of your button elements bounce? We selected them with $("button"), then we added some CSS classes to them with .addClass("animated bounce");.

You just used jQuery's .addClass() function, which allows you to add classes to elements.

First, let's target your div elements with the class well by using the $(".well") selector.

Note that, just like with CSS declarations, you type a . before the class's name.

Then use jQuery's .addClass() function to add the classes animated and shake.

For example, you could make all the elements with the class text-primary shake by adding the following to your document ready function:

$(".text-primary").addClass("animated shake");

Use the jQuery addClass() function to give the classes animated and shake to all your elements with the class well.
Only use jQuery to add these classes to the element.

----------------------------------------

<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $("button").addClass("animated bounce");
    $(".well").addClass("animated shake");
  });
</script>

092 - Target Elements by ID Using jQuery

----------------------------------------

You can also target elements by their id attributes.

First target your button element with the id target3 by using the $("#target3") selector.

Note that, just like with CSS declarations, you type a # before the id's name.

Then use jQuery's .addClass() function to add the classes animated and fadeOut.

Here's how you'd make the button element with the id target6 fade out:

$("#target6").addClass("animated fadeOut").

Select the button element with the id of target3 and use the jQuery addClass() function to give it the class of animated.
Target the element with the id target3 and use the jQuery addClass() function to give it the class fadeOut.
Only use jQuery to add these classes to the element.

----------------------------------------

<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $("button").addClass("animated bounce");
    $(".well").addClass("animated shake");
    $("#target3").addClass("animated fadeOut")
  });
</script>

094 - Target the same element with multiple jQuery Selectors

----------------------------------------

Now you know three ways of targeting elements: by type: $("button"), by class: $(".btn"), and by id $("#target1").

Although it is possible to add multiple classes in a single .addClass() call, let's add them to the same element in three separate ways.

Using .addClass(), add only one class at a time to the same element, three different ways:

Add the animated class to all elements with type button.

Add the shake class to all the buttons with class .btn.

Add the btn-primary class to the button with id #target1.

Note
You should only be targeting one element and adding only one class at a time. Altogether, your three individual selectors will end up adding the three classes shake, animated, and btn-primary to #target1.

Use the $("button") selector.
Use the $(".btn") selector.
Use the $("#target1") selector.
Only add one class with each of your three selectors.
Your #target1 element should have the classes animated‚ shake and btn-primary.
Only use jQuery to add these classes to the element.

----------------------------------------

<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $("button");
    $(".btn");
    $("#target1").addClass("animated");
    $("#target1").addClass("shake");
    $("#target1").addClass("btn-primary");
  });

095 - Remove Classes from an element with jQuery

----------------------------------------

In the same way you can add classes to an element with jQuery's addClass() function, you can remove them with jQuery's removeClass() function.

Here's how you would do this for a specific button:

$("#target2").removeClass("btn-default");

Let's remove the btn-default class from all of our button elements.

Remove the btn-default class from all of your button elements.
Only use jQuery to remove this class from the element.

096 - Change the CSS of an Element Using jQuery

----------------------------------------

We can also change the CSS of an HTML element directly with jQuery.
jQuery has a function called .css() that allows you to change the CSS of an element.
Here's how we would change its color to blue:
$("#target1").css("color", "blue");
This is slightly different from a normal CSS declaration, because the CSS property and its value are in quotes, and separated with a comma instead of a colon.
Delete your jQuery selectors, leaving an empty document ready function.
Select target1 and change its color to red.

Your target1 element should have red text.
Only use jQuery to add these classes to the element.

----------------------------------------

<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $("button").addClass("animated bounce");
    $(".well").addClass("animated shake");
    $("#target3").addClass("animated fadeOut");
    $("button").removeClass("btn-default");
    $("#target1").css("color", "red");

  });

097 - Disable an Element Using jQuery

----------------------------------------

You can also change the non-CSS properties of HTML elements with jQuery. For example, you can disable buttons.
When you disable a button, it will become grayed-out and can no longer be clicked.
jQuery has a function called .prop() that allows you to adjust the properties of elements.
Here's how you would disable all buttons:
$("button").prop("disabled", true);
Disable only the target1 button.

Disable your target1 button.
Do not disable any other buttons.
Only use jQuery to add these classes to the element.

----------------------------------------

<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $("#target1").css("color", "red");
    $("#target1").prop("disabled", true);

  });

098 - Change Text Inside an Element Using jQuery

----------------------------------------

Using jQuery, you can change the text between the start and end tags of an element. You can even change HTML markup.
jQuery has a function called .html() that lets you add HTML tags and text within an element. Any content previously within the element will be completely replaced with the content you provide using this function.
Here's how you would rewrite and emphasize the text of our heading:
$("h3").html("<em>jQuery Playground</em>");
jQuery also has a similar function called .text() that only alters text without adding tags. In other words, this function will not evaluate any HTML tags passed to it, but will instead treat it as the text you want to replace the existing content with.
Change the button with id target4 by emphasizing its text.

Emphasize the text in your target4 button by adding HTML tags.
Make sure the text is otherwise unchanged.
Do not alter any other text.
Make sure you are using .html() and not .text().
Make sure to select button id="target4" with jQuery.

----------------------------------------

<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $("#target1").css("color", "red");
    $("#target4").html("<em>#target4</em>");
    
  });

100 - Use appendTo to Move Elements with jQuery

----------------------------------------

Now let's try moving elements from one div to another.
jQuery has a function called appendTo() that allows you to select HTML elements and append them to another element.
For example, if we wanted to move target4 from our right well to our left well, we would use:
$("#target4").appendTo("#left-well");
Move your target2 element from your left-well to your right-well.

Your target2 element should not be inside your left-well.
Your target2 element should be inside your right-well.
Only use jQuery to move these elements.

----------------------------------------

<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $("#target1").css("color", "red");
    $("#target1").prop("disabled", true);
    $("#target4").remove();
    $("#target2").appendTo("#right-well");
  });
</script>
