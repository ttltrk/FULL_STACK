Use only natural colors

Use only ONE Base Color

Never use Black in your design

Yellow 

```

Also, it associates with curiosity, intelligence, brightness, etc.
```

Green

```
Is the color of harmony, nature, life and health. Also, it is often associated with money. 
In design, green can have a balancing and harmonizing effect.
```

Blue 

```
Means patience, peace, trustworthiness, and stability. It is one of the most beloved colors, 
especially by men. It is associated with professionalism, trust and honor. 
That's actually why the biggest social networks use blue.
```

Purple

```

purple can give a sense of wisdom, royalty, nobility, luxury, and mystery.
