HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the most widely used language on Web to develop web pages. HTML was created by 
Berners-Lee in late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML specification which was published in 1995. HTML 4.01 was a major 
version of HTML and it was published in late 1999. Though HTML 4.01 version is widely used but currently we are having HTML-5 version 
which is an extension to HTML 4.01, and this version was published in 2012.
