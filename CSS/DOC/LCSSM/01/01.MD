The basic structure of every web page, HTML, is very plain on its own. 
The beautiful websites that you see across the internet are styled with a variety of tools, including CSS.

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language that web developers use to style the HTML content on a web page. 
If you're interested in modifying colors, font types, font sizes, shadows, images, element positioning, and more, 
CSS is the tool for the job!

In this lesson, you'll learn how to select which HTML elements you wish to style and set up your CSS file structure.

<link href="style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">

What happened? Take some time to explore and experiment with the code in style.css.
