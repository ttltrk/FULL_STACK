Although CSS is a different language than HTML, it's possible to write CSS code directly within HTML code using inline styles.
To style an HTML element, you can add the style attribute directly to the opening tag. After you add the attribute, 
you can set it equal to the CSS style(s) you'd like applied to that element.

```html
<p style="color: red;">I'm learning to code!</p>
```

The code in the example above demonstrates how to use inline styling. The paragraph element has a style attribute 
within its opening tag. Next, the style attribute is set equal to ```color: red;```, which will set the color of the paragraph 
text to red within the browser.
You might be wondering about the syntax of the following snippet of ```code: color: red;```. 
At the moment, the details of the syntax are not important; you'll learn more about CSS syntax in other exercises. 
For now, it's important to know that inline styles are a quick way of directly styling an HTML element.
If you'd like to add more than one style with inline styles, simply keep adding to the style attribute. 
Make sure to end the styles with a semicolon ```(;)```.

```html
<p style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">I'm learning to code!</p>
```

  <div class="description">The Korean capital is a city of contrasts. Fourteenth-century city gates squat in the shadow of 21st-century skyscrapers, while the broad Han River is back-dropped by granite mountains rising in the city centercomplete with alpine highways speeding around their contours and temples nestling among their crags. Fashionable, gadget-laden youths battle for sidewalk space with fortune-tellers and peddlers, while tiny neighborhoods of traditional cottages contrast with endless ranks of identical apartments.
