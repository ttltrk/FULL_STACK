The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, 
hypermedia information systems. This is the foundation for data communication for the World Wide Web (i.e. internet) since 1990. 
HTTP is a generic and stateless protocol which can be used for other purposes as well using extensions of its request methods, 
error codes, and headers.

This tutorial is based on RFC-2616 specification, which defines the protocol referred to as HTTP/1.1. HTTP/1.1 is a revision 
of the original HTTP (HTTP/1.0). A major difference between HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 is that HTTP/1.0 uses a new connection 
for each request/response exchange, where as HTTP/1.1 connection may be used for one or more request/response exchanges.
